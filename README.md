### Surface

The website has a dark purple foreground `#140A27` and backgrounds both white and `rgb(186, 177, 200)`. Chosen for the [good contrast ratio](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=140A27&bcolor=BAB1C8) (9.26:1).

Headings used Georgia (serif) as a font while the rest of the text used Verdana (sans-serif) with Geneva and Tahoma as back ups.

Animation effects on the hero image draws the attention of the user as soon as the page loads. A white hallway was used as the background image for flair, and to evoke a heavenly hallway, yet remaining subtle enough to not draw attention away from the contents of the website.

Font awesome icons were added using:

## Features

### Header and Navigation

A translucent header background color with bold dark text centered. The navigation buttons with links to the three different pages in the site are underneath the header with a bold style to stand out in the page. The menu text is underlined whenever the mouse hovers over the link and the active page (the page the user is currently on) is indicated by an underline that remains.

### Home Page

#### Quote

An inspirational quote by Dante Alighieri on the main page: "Beauty awakens the soul to act." Written in italics to differentiate it from the rest of the test on the site.

#### Call to Action

A hero image of a hand holding a compact mirror with powder fades in when the screen loads with a call to action, encouraging the user to click on the link (within the image) to check out the beauty tips and tricks on the Beauty Hacks page. A background color matching the header was used in case the image never loads.

![Allow No Barrier](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103432143/170694088-ba9ce095-2a35-4f0f-8b1d-e77a0ea0eb44.png)

A box with a translucent background (like the header) with another call to action, given the user reasons why they should consider subscribing. An encouragement to click the link (within the box) that will take them to the Subscription page. Cloud icons taken fromt Font Awesome are used in lieu of bullet points.

![Why Subscribe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103432143/170695970-7da92ee6-1531-4b60-9ae8-946ecd2ea433.png)

The links on both of these sections have aria labels for the visually impaired.

### Beauty Hacks

The second page, which can be accessed either navigation button or the hero image, provides articles with cost saving beauty tips and tricks in addition to links to external articles which emphasize the importance of low income shoppers to the market and external links to Recommended Brands with affordable beauty products. The links open in a different tab and have aria labels for the visually impaired

![Articles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103432143/170695744-ec6e644a-e17e-470b-bbb8-7230d6b8cfb9.png)

![Recommended Beauty Brands](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103432143/170695836-994504b7-79cf-45e5-bb71-7266d59a46ad.png)

The background with the purple lipstick provides added flair and remains in keeping with the color theme of the website. It's opacity is 0.9 to ensure that although it stands out against the background, some of the background image can still be glimpsed.

### Subscribe Now

The Subscribe Now page can be accessed either through the box in the Home Page or the navigation button. It takes the user to a page with a form to fill out. The text inputs are marked as required, so users cannot leave them blank. The personal information fieldset asks typical personal questions: Name, Age, Gender, Email. The latter through which Heavenly Beauty will contact the client. 

![Personal Details](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103432143/170697988-d4c5642d-dc83-40db-a2fb-f804f9df8d7c.png)

Gender uses a drop down menu (as it takes up less space than radio labels), which gives a beautiful view of the calming background image. 

![Screenshot 2022-05-27 at 13 22 48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103432143/170698480-e6ea9283-b830-4d1e-a5d9-34f62f532cdf.png)

The second fieldset asks additional questions related to the users routine, tastes and means - as well as interest in certain brands. The information taken from the client and stored in the database will be analysed by an algorithm which will produce the best suited regimens for the client in question. In addition, the special offers will be refined to their tastes, especially regarding the brands that they're interested in. Drop down menus are used instead of radio labels to take up less space on the page.

The submit button at the bottom is large enough that it cannot be missed. When the mouse hovers over the button, the colors reverse. Cloud icons from font awesome are added to the text for style.

Attempting to submit without filling in the required fields, gets an error message.
