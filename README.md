## Heavenly Beauty 

A website for those looking for cost effective beauty tips and tricks, as well as a subscribe and pay service that sends customers personalised beauty regimines monthly for only 3.99 (GBP). An algorithm uses the information collected from users who fill out a form to ensure the beauty regimine is well suited to the client. 

Business goals are to become a trusted source for clients looking for affordable beauty regimines and encourage subscription with periodic special offers and discounts (due to partnerships with beauty brands) and algorithm-assisted routines sent monthly. 

## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy

#### User Stories

1. I've been perusing the web in search of makeup tutorials but very often it appears expensive makeup is needed to achieve any of the looks. I wish to visit a site that can offer cost saving tips and tricks. 

2. I've been searching the web in the hopes of finding a source that can redirect me to the cheaper beauty brands available. 

3. I want to find a beauty regimine that is tailor suited to me, my skin type, my means and my tastes. 

4. I appreciate that this website gives specialised beauty regimine but would like a bit more incentive to subscribe to this beauty site as opposed to others.

5. I would like to find a site with easy navigation and accessibility. 

#### Why Heavenly Beauty?

Heavenly Beauty will send emails to subscribers with special offers and vouchers. For only 3.99 (GBP) a month, customers will receive monthly beauty regimines tailor suited to them, created with the help of an algorithm that uses information from the form. There will also be a chance to win a free makeover from one of our expert beauticians. 

Easy navigation between the three pages in the website. Homepage provides links to the different sections of the site in addition to the navigation bar. The website is also friendly to those with impaired vision. 

### Scope

The website has three pages, the landing page, the second page with articles and the final page with the subscription form. 

Two articles in the second page to avoid overload, with images for decoration. Enough to give visitors of the website useful information that they can use in their day to day lives. 

Aria-labels for each of the unlabelled links to allow accessibility. 

Links to three social media platforms so users have multiple ways to contact Heavenly Beauty as well as learn more about us. 

Form with multiple sections in subscription page to ensure as much information can be taken from the user as possible without overwhelming them.

### Structure 

Three navigation bars underneath the header that link to different pages in the site, with the an underline indicating which page is the active page. 

A hero image that makes the purpose of the website clear with a link to the second page of the website for ease. 

A 'why subscribe' section under the hero image with a concise list with a link to the subscription page for ease. 

A footer with social media icons that open in another tab to the social media pages of Heavenly Beauty.

Articles in the second page with tips and tricks and external links to recommended brand websites.

A third page with a form to fill out that provides information to the algorithm and the staff at Heavenly Beauty.

### Surface

The website has a dark purple foreground `#140A27` and backgrounds both white and `rgb(186, 177, 200)`. Chosen for the [good contrast ratio](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=140A27&bcolor=BAB1C8).

Headings used Georgia (serif) as a font while the rest of the text used Verdana (sans-serif) with Geneva and Tahoma as back ups.

Animation effects on the hero image draws the attention of the user as soon as the page loads. A white hallway was used as the background image for flair, yet remaining subtle enough to not draw attention away from the contents of the website.

Font awesome icons were added using:
