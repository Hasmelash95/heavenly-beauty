# Hermon Asmelash Portfolio Project

## UX

### Strategy

#### User Stories

I've been perusing the web in search of makeup tutorials but very often it appears expensive makeup is needed to achieve any of the looks. I wish to visit a sit that can offer cost saving tips and tricks. 

I've been searching the web in the hopes of finding a source that can redirect them to the cheaper beauty brands available. 

I want to find a beauty regimine that is tailor suited to me, my skin type, my means and my tastes tastes. 

I appreciate that this website gives specialised beauty regimine but would like a bit more incentive to subscribe to this beauty site as opposed to others.

I would like to find a site with easy navigation and accessibility. 

#### Why Heavenly Beauty?

Heavenly Beauty will send emails to subscribers with special offers and vouchers. There will also be a chance to win a free makeover from one of our expert beauticians. 

Easy navigation between the three pages in the website. Homepage will provide links to the different sections of the site in addition to the navigation bar. The website will also be friendly to those with impaired vision. 

There is no cost to subscription.

### Scope

The website will be three pages, the landing page, the second page with articles and the final page with the subscription form. 

Animation effects on hero (main) image to entice the user as soon as the home page loads. 

Two articles in the second page to avoid overload, with images for decoration. Enough to give visitors of the website useful information that they can use in their day to day lives. 

Aria-labels for each of the unlabelled links to allow accessibility. 

Links to three social media platforms so users have multiple ways to contact Heavenly Beauty as well as learn more about us. 

Form with multiple sections in subscription page to ensure as much information can be taken from the user as possible without overwhelming them.

### Structure 

Three navigation bars underneath the header that highlight when the mouse hovers over. The highlight remains on the navigation bar of the active page so the user will always know where they are in the site. This will be useful if the site were to grow and multiple pages were to be added.

A hero image that makes the purpose of the website clear with a link to the second page of the website for ease. 

A 'why subscribe' section under the hero image with a concise list. The section's border radius shifts when the mouse hovers over it. It will contain a link to the third page of the website. 

A footer with social media icons that open in another tag to the social media pages of Heavenly Beauty.
