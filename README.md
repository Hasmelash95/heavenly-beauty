## Heavenly Beauty 

A website for those looking for cost effective beauty tips and tricks, as well as a subscribe and pay service that sends customers personalised beauty regimines monthly for only 3.99 (GBP).

Business goals are to become a trusted source for clients looking for affordable beauty regimines and encourage subscription with periodic special offers and discounts (due to partnerships with beauty brands) and algorithm-assisted routines sent monthly.
