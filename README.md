### Surface

The website has a dark purple foreground `#140A27` and backgrounds both white and `rgb(186, 177, 200)`. Chosen for the [good contrast ratio](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=140A27&bcolor=BAB1C8) (9.26:1).

Headings used Georgia (serif) as a font while the rest of the text used Verdana (sans-serif) with Geneva and Tahoma as back ups.

Animation effects on the hero image draws the attention of the user as soon as the page loads. A white hallway was used as the background image for flair, yet remaining subtle enough to not draw attention away from the contents of the website.

Font awesome icons were added using:
