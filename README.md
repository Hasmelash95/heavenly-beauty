## User Experience (UX)

### Strategy

#### User Stories

I've been perusing the web in search of makeup tutorials but very often it appears expensive makeup is needed to achieve any of the looks. I wish to visit a site that can offer cost saving tips and tricks. 

I've been searching the web in the hopes of finding a source that can redirect me to the cheaper beauty brands available. 

I want to find a beauty regimine that is tailor suited to me, my skin type, my means and my tastes. 

I appreciate that this website gives specialised beauty regimine but would like a bit more incentive to subscribe to this beauty site as opposed to others.

I would like to find a site with easy navigation and accessibility. 

#### Why Heavenly Beauty?

Heavenly Beauty will send emails to subscribers with special offers and vouchers. For only 3.99 (GBP) a month, customers will receive monthly beauty regimines tailor suited to them, created with the help of an algorithm that uses information from the form. There will also be a chance to win a free makeover from one of our expert beauticians. 

Easy navigation between the three pages in the website. Homepage will provide links to the different sections of the site in addition to the navigation bar. The website will also be friendly to those with impaired vision. 

### Scope

The website will be three pages, the landing page, the second page with articles and the final page with the subscription form. 

Two articles in the second page to avoid overload, with images for decoration. Enough to give visitors of the website useful information that they can use in their day to day lives. 

Aria-labels for each of the unlabelled links to allow accessibility. 

Links to three social media platforms so users have multiple ways to contact Heavenly Beauty as well as learn more about us. 

Form with multiple sections in subscription page to ensure as much information can be taken from the user as possible without overwhelming them.

### Structure 

Three navigation bars underneath the header that. 

A hero image that makes the purpose of the website clear with a link to the second page of the website for ease. 

A 'why subscribe' section under the hero image with a concise list with a link to the subscription page for ease. 

A footer with social media icons that open in another tab to the social media pages of Heavenly Beauty.
